# hello-world
Hello, everyone. I'm new to GitHub. :)

I have no experience of coding, but I'm interested in it.
Therefore, I'm now learning Python online by myself.
I attend online courses, including a class on Udemy and many video clips on YT.
Moreover I brought a great book of Python which is written by Bill Lubanovic.
I wrote a Blog to take learning notes https://db35reset.wordpress.com/ (as you can see... yes, my native language is Chinese, so please forgive me for my poor English writing skill. :P)

I do all those things in order to become a software engineer in the future.
However, I know it's just a beginning... I have so so so many new things to learn and, of course, GitHub is one of them.
